This is a website that's going to essentially be a video database for all video games. Users will be able to browse the entire game collection.
Users will also be able to search games by platform, release date, metacritic score, and other categories.
When a user clicks on an individual game, they'll be taken to a detailed view of the game. This will include screenshots, links to storefronts
where it's available for purchase, list of achievements, and more. 
Users will be able to add games to their wishlist and will be able to add any game to their 'collection', signifying ownership.
They'll be able to view their wishlists and collections on their profile page. 
Eventually, I'd like to add the ability to comment on each game's page, as well as a featured game each week that's displayed on the home page of 
the website.
It's mostly a passion project for me as I love video games and want to share that love with people all over the world.
